The case has raised questions about where criticism ends and criminal conduct begins. The mass shooting at Bondi Beach during a Hanukkah event created major challenges for journalists trying to confirm fast-moving details. Newsrooms had to decide how to describe the attack, when to name suspects, and how to treat unverified online posts. Jacqueline Maley, senior writer at the Sydney Morning Herald, explains the decisions behind early reporting and the influence of social media. In Florida, Donald Trump has filed a defamation case against the BBC over an edited sequence in the Panorama documentary, which triggered the resignation of the corporation&apos;s Director General and its CEO of News. Stuart M Benjamin, professor of law at Duke University, sets out the legal issues.</desc><image>https://img.freeviewplay.tv/p70541ab4a560c5c1d9b35902d48d9280?w=800</image></programme>
